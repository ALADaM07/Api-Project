# Project Description
The project aims to develop a user-friendly web application that provides real-time cryptocurrency prices in USD. Users will be able to easily access the prices of various cryptocurrencies, along with important metrics such as percentage changes in price over the past 1 hour, 24 hours, and 7 days. Additionally, the application will display the 24-hour trading volume and market capitalization for each cryptocurrency.

To enhance usability, the application will feature a convenient search bar, allowing users to quickly find specific coins and view their details and prices in USD.

## Nice to Have
Implementation of interactive charts illustrating the price trends of each coin over the past 7 days.

Incorporation of a currency selection option, enabling users to view cryptocurrency prices in their preferred currency.

To ensure smooth operation of the project, the following considerations have been made:

## API Rating:
The API has a rate limit of 10-30 requests per minute.

## Data Availability: 
The desired data is readily accessible through the API, facilitating seamless integration into the web application.

### CORS Support: 
The API supports Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS), ensuring secure retrieval of data from the server.
